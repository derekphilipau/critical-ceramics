<P>
While there are many exhibits of contemporary ceramic art, few can claim to be truly international. This fact sets the eighth Biannual International Ceramic Art Competition and Exhibition at Carouge, Switzerland (22 September through 25 November 2001) apart from others. Earlier exhibits in this series featured predominately Swiss and French artists, but the 2001 event was extremely diverse including two American artists. Following a widely publicized invitation, 543 color slide submissions were received from artists in 47 countries on five continents. Of these, 52 artists were picked by jurors. This yearï¿½s theme was the clay candlestick &#147Le Chandelier Ceramique&#148. The only limitation was that entries could not exceed 40 centimeters in height. Awards totaling 10,000 Swiss francs were presented.</P>


<P>
Carouge, directly across Le Rhone River from Geneva, has a long history of involvement with ceramics. In the 19th and early 20th centuries factories here produced roofing tiles and housewares. The area also attracted many clay artisans. Today, Carouge has chosen to honor its heritage by hosting a biannual (begun in 1987) ceramic arts event. The Carouge Biannual has grown significantly since its inception in 1987, and will undoubtedly continue to attracted accomplished artists.</P>
<P>
The 2001 competition exhibition was by all measures the most successful to date. The diversity of work exhibited was impressive and the public response was understandably strong. While a theme exhibition places some constraints on the artists, the theme causes an artist to consider creative ideas and methods outside of their normal scope. Events such as this competition can be opportunities for artistic risk taking. Further, the theme provides the viewer with a basis of comparison not always available. Within the framework of the current exhibition, the artists seemed to have visual ideas that went well beyond the basic candle holder. </P>
<P>
The candle holder afforded participating artists considerable interpretive latitude. The works at the Musee du Carouge were both visually satisfying and innovative. Before arriving to see the works, I had viewed catalogs from two earlier biannuals in this series. The overall level of work was superior this year, attributable to the greater number and diversity of entrants and, perhaps, more discerning jurors. It may be, too, that clay artists are just getting better. The competition winners were Pauline Wiertz from Amsterdam and two Belgians Jo Jacobs an Toon Thijs.</P>
<P>
Born in 1955, Pauline Wiertz attended the Academy Gerrit Rietveld of Amsterdam (1972-79). She studied ceramics at Academy Minerva at Groningue (1988-89) at the Academy of Art & Design in Bois-e-Duc (1992) and at Tehatex in Amsterdam (1992-94). She has exhibited in Japan and Holland.</P>
<P>
Jo Jacobs was born 1971 in Belgium. In 1995, she received a diploma in design from the Academy of Genk (Belgium). Her concentration was in ceramics as applied to interior architecture and design.</P>
<P>
Toon Thijs was born in 1948 in Belgium. He studied ceramic art with Diane Wynants of Hasselt. He has exhibited extensively in Belgium and was chosen to exhibit in the 1997 International Biannual in Carcouge.</P>
<P>
Running concurrently with this year's Biannual competition, were exhibitions at local art galleries and an a number of other public venues. Many of the artists were well known names, including established clay artists from Switzerland, France, Germany, England, Japan. However, the field was uneven. While there were some works that were highly creative and showed superior skill, there were those that lacked originality and freshness. Unlike the competition which was full of risk taking, most works in this portion of the event were artistically safe and seemed more commercially driven. The selection process (the organizing committee in consultation with individual venue owners) may have ruled out the most adventurous.</P>
<P>
A noted exception was Swiss artist Weiner Theiles whose works were show at Gallerie Marianne Brand. Theiles, 42, is mentally challenged and began working in clay a decade ago as a part of his therapy. Uninhibited by art training and exposure to other&#146s work, his creations are free and uncompromised. The Gallerie Marianne Brand in Carouge has exhibited Theiles work four times since 1994 and he has also shown at galleries in Bern and Spiez. </P>
<P>
In conjunction with these two events, an outstanding special exhibition &#147La Poterie Africaine&#148 was assembled. This exhibition featured historical and contemporary African pottery from European museum collections. In addition, a series of lectures, demonstrations, and film presentation were given on African ceramics.</P>
<P>
Overall, the eighth Biannual International Ceramic Art Competition and Exhibition at Carouge, Switzerland was worth the time and effort to see. The reputations of masters were reconfirmed and some new artists established themselves on the international stage. Already plans are underway for the 2003 event. Persons interested in this event may write Jean M. Marguis, Musee de Carouge, Place de Sardaigne 2, Carouge, Switzerland or email: <A HREF="mailto:musee@carouge.ch">musee@carouge.ch</A>. </P>
