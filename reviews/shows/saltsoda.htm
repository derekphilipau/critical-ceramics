SALT & SODA FIRING: ALWAYS AN ADVENTURE<BR>

<P>
For many years, potters have sprayed salt or soda solutions into kilns as the temperature was rising. Depending on the artist, the kiln, and the amount of chemical used, atmospheric firing can produce a matte or orange peel finish and attractive blushes of color. Fumes from salt firing contain hydrochloric acid, which is toxic to humans and the environment. Many artists now favor the similar, but more benign, soda firing technique.
</P>

<P>
What is your experience with salt and soda firing? What does it do for you expressively? Critical Ceramics put these questions to Sam Chung, Maren Kloppmann, and Ron Meyers. All three artists recently showed in a big group exhibition at Chicago&#146s Lill Street Studios.*
</P>

<FONT FACE=helvetica, arial>
<P>
Incredible Variation
</P>
</FONT>

<P>
Everyone agrees that salt/soda firing means less control for the artist, which can be a good thing. &#147The soda kiln gives me an incredible variation from one firing to another,&#148 says Kloppmann. &#147Soda alters the surface subtly, leaves a very small trace. I walk a strange line between having control and giving it up. There&#146s always some accident in the process.&#148
</P>

<P>
Chung calls soda firing &#147uncontrollable.&#148  Raw clay &#147becomes shiny wherever the soda touches it,&#148 he states. &#147The way soda reacts with the piece is very localized. Where to place greenware in the kiln becomes an issue.&#148
</P>

<P>
He adds that where to spray the soda solution is equally important because &#147the fume follows the circulation of the flame.&#148 He sprays in eight different places in the kiln and thinks that an artist&#146s knowledge of their kiln should guide these decisions.
</P>

<P>
Chung&#146s elegant work is decorated with subdued colors and a crackle glaze. &#147I got into salt/soda firing the way most artists do,&#148 he states. &#147When I used regular glazes, I got predictable results. After college, I wanted something different, wanted mystery.
</P>

<P>
&#147My whole reason for changing,&#148 he continues, &#147was to emphasize the forms in my work. Soda fluxes the glaze and fades the color around the edges to intensify the linear quality of the work.&#148
</P>

<FONT FACE=helvetica, arial>
<P>
Just a Little Shine
</P>
</FONT>

<P>
Ron Meyers started salt firing because he wanted to make his painted earthenware more expressive. &#147People saw only the image in my work, not the form,&#148 he says. &#147High temperature salt firing gives a wet look&#151just a little shine&#151that gets me away from pretty transparent glazes. Salt firing softened my colors and I started to draw more directly into the clay. Recently I went to low temperature firing.&#148
</P>

<P>
Meyers has worked with both salt and soda atmospheres. &#147At one point I started using soda in my kiln, found that it was caustic to the bricks, and went back to salt,&#148 he states. &#147Results from atmospheric firing vary depending on where you put the piece in the kiln. You get a darker finish in the back, a warmer finish at the front.&#148
</P>

<P>
Meyers often incises drawings of animals into the surfaces of his vessels. Some pieces incorporate animal forms, like the frog-shaped handles on his Tureen. He favors quiet colors like tan, dark orange, and cream. Though influenced by Oriental art, he is more funky than formal.
</P>

<P>
We see the hand everywhere in Meyers&#146 roughly slip finished vessels. &#147I don&#146t want to make a perfect pot,&#148 he says. &#147I put my hands all over it so my process shows. The cats, mice, frogs, and birds on my vessels are part of my personal history. I have always taken an interest in Kingfishers and like their personality.&#148
</P>

<FONT FACE=helvetica, arial>
<P>
Go For It
</P>
</FONT>

<P>
Oriental in form, Maren Kloppmann&#146s ceramics are decorated with blushes of color and a crackle glaze. Some surfaces have white streaks brushed on them. Tiny rectangular holes piercing the work suggest windows or doorways.
</P>

<P>
&#147I combine glaze and Terra-Sigillata to get those surfaces and blushes,&#148 says the artist. &#147I spray very small amounts of soda into the kiln. It is carried through the flame onto the piece. Soda gives me subtle color variations. It substitutes for salt firing, which harms the environment.&#148
</P>

<P>
Terra-Sigillata, which dates from Greek and Roman times, is a blend of superfine clays that the artist brushes on greenware as a thin slip. &#147It sits on the surface and maintains a sheen,&#148 she says. &#147But beyond a certain point, you cannot really control what you get.&#148
</P>

<P>
Kloppmann has developed under European, American, and Oriental influences. She came to the United States from her native Germany at the age of 22 and was exposed to contemporary American ceramics. She admires the &#147simple way that Scandinavian clay artists put together a few visual elements&#148 and is drawn to the &#147serenity and simplicity&#148 of Noguchi and Brancusi. Acknowledging the architectural element in her ceramics, she explains that she studied mixed media with a Japanese architecture teacher after she had been making pottery for about a decade.
</P>

<P>
When we asked Kloppmann what advice she would give to artists who are just starting out with salt/soda firing, she said: &#147Go through every technique, learn by doing, then choose what&#146s best for you. I was very lucky in my education,&#148 she adds, &#147because my teachers made me try everything.&#148
&#147Go for it,&#148 says Chung. &#147Try it every way you can and learn your kiln. You will discover how to adjust the atmosphere by changing the amount of oxygen or soda. You will find that some glazes give brighter colors and that a soda atmosphere delivers softer colors than salt.&#148
</P>

<P>
Chung told us what he wants people to see &#147something beautiful and timeless&#148 when they look at his vessels. &#147My work is classic forms reseen,&#148 he states. &#147There are thousands of years of  history attached to ceramic art.&#148
