</FONT><HR>The Digtal/Elemental is a panel topic at the upcomming NCECA. Panelists include Rick Parsons of Anderson Ranch Art Center, Colby Parsons-O'Keefe of Texas Women's Univesity, and Brian Bolden of Michgan State University. The panel will be moderated by Fred Spaulding of University of Texas Pan American. <p>In order to take our discussion into a public forum and invite the participation of any who are interested we have posted this thread to the Critical Ceramics web site. <p>Below is our beginning point. I am looking forward to the discussion.<p>In today�s world, the influence of digital technology affects us in so many ways it is difficult to distinguish how pervasive it is. The question is: "What impact does the influence of a digital world have on artists working in clay?"  <br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I see a simular pattern forming between technology and how culture either embraces or rejects it. In our current cuture, digital communication has introduced a level of dematerialation of physical exprience to a point of the predictable over reaction which rejects technolgy and longs for a more simple time. This is clearly evident in Visual Art with the  domination of the photographic and vidio image(New Media) and the predictable backlash that celebrates traditional media ( Painting, Drawing , Ceramics) as a way of reclaming that tagible, unmediated response to an increasingly virtual environment. It is interesting to me that the traditional media is re surfacing as needed point of reflection, a actual physical experience that can't be dematerialized in to a string of coded instructions and it shared globally, instantly.  It seems that traditional media provides this need for direct experience, The impact of our new digital world is becoming emmbedded in current practices and content. I submit that  reacting for or against  technolgy is missing  the true excitment of our times.  We are living in a composite environment where our sources of imformation and communication are a hybrid between the vitual and actual, a space that is for ever altering creative and cultural responses. Ceramics has the potential to be a at the fore front of this new environment if we can expand our traditions to include contemporary responses. This can move Ceramics beyond the traditional, and historical reference, a contemporary practice that longs for a more simple time to a strong participant in this new digital, global culture.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Brian:<br>Thanks for tossing the first stone in the pond.  You have put your finger on what I sensed was the most important similarity between the panelists. Namely that we are all interested in exploring the possibilities offered by the confluence of new technology and the practice of ceramic artists rather then relying on the warm comfort of past traditions to determine our processes. In searching for a way forward with the discussion let�s get a little more specific about some of the new technology and it�s current and potential influence on ceramic practice.  One example that comes to mind from the 2002 NCECA Journal is the panel of Steven Thurston Rebecca Horning and Jeff Kell, moderated by Anna Callouri Holcombe titled �Digital Imaging Within a Ceramic Studio Environment� (196).  This panel focused on the CAD/CAM technology that allows one to design shapes in the computer then �print� them out in three dimensions.  Let�s outline some of the other technical influences and then move outward to address our responses.  I am hoping to get some input from the 2002 �Digital Imaging� panel and from others outside our current panel.<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To focus on the digital part of the discussion, I propose dividing the effects of technology on artistic practice into three main areas of influence: direct technical influence, direct content influence, and indirect influence.  <p>Direct technical influence involves technical options that have expanded our range of expression.  In some cases new technology makes it possible to do things we have never done before, such as using Computer Aided Design modeling and 3-D �printing� to create precisely engineered forms.  In other cases, improvements in technology have lowered the price of a certain process drastically (or offered a similar way to get the same result), making it far more accessible.  An example of this is Xerox or inkjet transfer.  Another direct influence is the use of digital technology itself in a multimedia piece; for example, using video or sound (both of which could have been used previously, but have become far easier to record, edit and play back).<p>Direct content influence involves artwork made as an explicit commentary on living in a �computer age�, or when the content seems clearly derived from the concerns of a digital culture.  This can show up as sculptures of computers or cell-phones, or the incorporation of images or patterns derived from digital technology.  Faux-ancient pottery with anachronistic imagery as part of the decoration is an excellent example.  Also, a great deal of the text used in artwork can be seen as the product of an information-saturated society, especially when its presentation derives from advertising layouts.<p>Indirect influence involves the ways in which digital technology has changed our approaches or modes of thought, and that in turn has affected our artwork.  To me this is the most evasive aspect to define, and also the most interesting.  I say �evasive� because the types of influence I am talking about have become so commonplace as to fade into the background.  The internet is probably the most obvious indirect influence � making it easy to communicate with other artists or find information relating to our field.  Such communication has made it possible to be part of a much larger community of artists if we choose to be.  I suspect, however, that there are less obvious influences.  I recall a moment several years ago after I had just gotten familiar with a computer graphics program, when I made a mistake on a clay sculpture and I had a split-second urge to press UNDO.  The possibility of a different kind of revision had crept into my thinking.  Now I�m not saying for certain that such a change affected my work, but I�m not sure if I could identify it if it had.  That is the sort of indirect influence I am enquiring into.  If you have any thoughts on the matter, please share them.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Looks like we have all made it. I have read some great points from you three. This is a very interesting topic with many open avenues to travel down. Colby has picked three strong points to ponder (Direct Technical Influence, Direct Content Influence and Indirect Influence). Under these three umbrella terms we can start to pin point and mine our thoughts. This can be a difficult topic because technology has become ingrained in our physical and mental worlds. We as artist are participating in this new world willing or not willing. It is our job as artist to respond to our surroundings.<p>Direct Technical Influence: <p>Colby, I believe you have a great point when you say that technology allows an expansion of artistic expression. The job of the artist is to look for the appropriate technologies to record or create a new vision of the world via sound, image, object, installation and performance.<p> Technologies also take different form in the hands of an artist then in the hands of a scientist/designer. If this is true how is the artist influencing technology and how is technology influencing the artist? If most technological advancement is fueled by the military, commercialism, and the government then is it the job of the artist to take these new tools and use them in a new way not the same way�The conversation about the CAD program at 2002 NCECA talked more about the technology itself then how an artist might implement this new tool.  This is a very expensive process that most independent artist would never be able to afford. Will artist have to form research centers/groups to afford these new tools? What does the artist studio of the future look like?  Just thoughts and questions!!<p>Direct content:<p>Is it the artist role to critque new technologies and do they need to be involved in them to understand them?<p>I like your comment Brian � ... demineralization of the physical experience and ones need for the traditional media is resurfacing. Maybe the current role of a sculpture is do be able to give both to the viewer. I saw a piece of Colby�s that flirted with this idea. If I remember correctly it was an image projected on the wall of a ceramic object that was sitting right they�re for the viewer to see. The viewer is then has to battle with themselves to figure out which one to look at. <p>Indirect Influence:<p>This is evasive as Colby states because by adopting these technologies the vision of the artist may become impaired. <br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>As for the three categories mentioned (Direct Technical, Direct Content and Indirect) I think the internet plays a principal role, transcending each of the categories.  <p>Direct Technical: The internet provides an opportunity for easy exchange of information, materials and technology, making processes and new technology more viable to artists regardless of location.  <p>Direct Content: The internet is largely responsible for the over saturation of information in our current society, which is likely to surface in any artists� work that addresses our current culture.  Because it has become so commonplace, as Colby mentioned, it is hard to pinpoint how pervasive that influence might be.  I know that I have seen some of Fred�s work directly addresses the internet. Other artists� work is probably influenced by the internet, maybe in less obvious or conscious ways, but being an artist living in this time, it is almost impossible to ignore.<p>Indirect Influence: Besides creating an incredible communication network (evident in the fact that we are able to carry on this discussion), the internet has created an opportunity for a virtual gallery of numerous artists, providing exposure beyond what traditional galleries and printed publications can accomplish.  However, these virtual images are usually low quality and certainly do not replace the experience of viewing the actual object in a gallery or even a high resolution photograph in a printed publication.  This raises some interesting questions about the virtual vs the actual world that I think tie in to what Brian said �digital communication has introduced a level of dematerialation of physical experience to a point of the predictable over reaction which rejects technology and longs for a more simple time.�  <p>I agree with Rick in his statement that �We as artists are participating in this new world willing or not willing.�  A digital revolution is happening whether we like it or not and we can either choose to embrace it or reject it. <br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I very much like the way that this discussion in shaping up. Colbys� divisions make great sense and seem to create a clear structure for our panel.  I think the larger question for me is how to address the Direct Technical.  One idea may be to embed the Direct technical within the Direct Content and Indirect Influence areas of influence by each panel members through their slide presentation. This could be followed up in Q and A with the hope that the discussion does not get to technical. I agree that the direct content and indirect influence aspects are the most intriguing and perhaps the most challenging to present well. I think this should be the goal.<p>My first thought about the three area of digital influence was to imagine the same three areas with digital replaced by elemental.  What would be a contemporary response to elemental technical, direct content influences elemental, and indirect influences elemental? As ceramic people would this response be traditional, nostalgic, or has contemporary experience affected our impulse for the elemental. Is elemental/ material influence as �evasive� as the digital? It seems that the full range of subtlety of this relationship is so vital and interesting.<p>In the January 04 issue of ARTFORUM the curators of the up coming Whitney Biennial were interviewed about their process and experience of selecting artists.  Shamin Momin one of the curators had this to say: � Throughout the work in this exhibition, there is a deep investment in materiality and process, but there is also a kind of internalization of the metaphorical and conceptual structures of technology. � This seems to support the need for artists to have a certain kind of physical control over medium that is impossible with electronic media. Perhaps this could be a way to develop our discussion. Is the elemental impulse about a need for a kind of control over visual information?<p><p><br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Welcome panelists and other contributors. Participants from outside the panel, please identify yourself on your initial post including any institutional affiliation.<p> In terms of breaking down the overall subject of a digital influence or digital/elemental confluence I was tending to begin with the technical/physical aspects of the digital then proceed to outline the cultural influences and finally to address the various types of responses to the tools and the culture.  I think this correlates with Colby�s points as well.<p>I.)Digital Tools available to artists:<p>-imaging tools<br>-production tools<br>-communication/presentation tools<br>-glaze calculation software<br>-other???<p><br>II.)Cultural Influences associated with the digital:<p>-Immersion in a culture increasingly defined by manipulation of information rather then manipulation of material<p>-Transference of material to code, digitization and transmission of sense data in large volumes<p>-Increased access to information, historical or current, multicultural??<p>-Increased ability to communicate (modes and forums for individual authorship)<p>-Decreased economic reliance on mechanical production ???<p>-Increasing access (still determined by social and economic status)<p>-Continuing influence/need for the elemental as response or innate need<p><br>III.)Conceptual Response to the digital:<p>-complicit responses (accepting the tools and exploring their use, exploring the ramifications of influences)<p>-critical responses (questioning the tools and their use, using the tools to critique art or other social structures.<br>	<br>IV.)Forms/Codes/Processes generated by the artist to explore or critique the digital<br>	-altered photography<br>	-use of language or computer code<br>	-images of the tools themselves<br>	-products of computer calculations  such as genetic code<br>	-animation, video, web transmission<br>	-multi media installation<br>	-shifts away from traditional studio practice toward??<br>	-Ceramic specific modes of response???<p>Brian:  <br>Overall the panel is a discussion of our specific digital/elemental responses in an effort to help establish some perspective through differing viewpoints. I would like everyone to outline specific technical aspects of software, hardware, input, output, resources, links, etc so that I can post those to a website. Then we can refer in depth technical questions to that instead of spending a lot of time trying to explain them. If you can use a Word document, that would be great.  I will publish the technical information on the website here.  How does that sound?<p>In terms of definitions I think we should define �digital� as dealing with the computer/encoding of information and related topics, and that we define �elemental� as the influence of physical material especially clay, fire, water, etc.<p>In keeping with the discussion format of a panel I propose that we each make a short presentation of our response to digital/elemental influences (10 min or less) and structure the remaining time around questions for/by panelists.  This would give about half our allotted time for discussion as well as some time at the end for audience questions. <p>What I hope for with this online discussion is to generate a set of relevant questions to address in the discussion phase of the panel. I think that the general categories of questions will be something like the following:<p>-specific questions about the relationship of digital/elemental concerns for each panelist<br>	<br>-questions about future possibilities/ speculation on development of ceramic <br>   process- under the influence.<p>I am really interested in your questioning of the influence of the elemental both in terms of the effort to establish some kind of control and in terms of the �contemporary elemental�. I would interpret contemporary elemental as driven by an interest in what new clay products can do. Maybe the most contemporary elemental tool is a catalog of ready made dishes or building materials. Maybe a manufactured product is not elemental though�..???<p>Contemporary-elemental forms would be experimental configurations of these products, I feel close to this idea in my work.<p>As for control I do think that making ceramic objects from digital source material is a way to bring that information into a physical form. To solidify it and be able to touch it makes it seem somehow more readily digestible.<p>What interests me the most is how does the digital influence affect the cognitive process directly (like Colby�s UNDO thought) and how does this come out in the work? Or do we still begin from the elemental and then apply the digital?</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>From my perspective in this discussion we are cutting the pie into little pieces and its important to remember that the slicing itself is a construct that has no existance. I call myself a clayer, but i may as well call myself a player. While these two media seem immiscible, I think this is only because of preconceptions in our heads. They might take another generation to get them emulsified. <p>But While it is rare for my mud and digital excusions to mix they do sometimes (from my point of view this is digital ceramic art), but I don't mud a circuits as being all that different. What, at its most basic level is the difference betweeen glaze calculation software and a coffeee mug? I don't think there is a whole lot. Hit me on the head with the board, but I know that you can't program a coffee mug to do glaze calculation.<p>I really don't want to seem anti cutting the cake or pie, we often have to to eat it, but I think when we get to our studios we should remember to pick the whole cake up and take a big bit out of it.<p>I hope someone can follow this.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Louis,<p>Your comments make me hungry... but also remind me that our processes are holistic and subdividing them does distort our view somewhat. Still I believe that the construct of slicing has a value in understanding ideas and connections. I know you have done some experiments with claymation and other digital applications to clay. What kind of effect have these types of experiments had if any on your process of art making? <br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I don't think the claymation has had any impact of any significance, yet. It may. I think at the route level I was laready thinking about clay as being far more than a material. I think it is more useful to think about clay as a material-set/history/aesthetic-set/conceptual-set, than jsut a material. <br>I believe that paintings, movies, and just about anything else can be ceramics as we generally use the term. I don't think it needs a smidge of clay. <br>For me this machine it is just another tool. As far as I am concerned this post is ceramic art.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well frankly Louis, no I didn�t follow much of what you said.  But there is one thing I started chewing on � the idea that as ceramicists we have a viewpoint that goes beyond our material.  This suggests that the identity of our field could continue to exist even in the absence of clay itself.  If so, what is that identity?  How is it different from sculpture or design?  If technology allows us the same freedom with form ten years from now as the freedom we currently have with 2-D images (to create, scan, cut, paste, manipulate and print), how will it affect ceramics?  Will it even further polarize us? -- launching some into a new role that is connected to ceramics, but encompasses many things outside of it as well, while others protect the vision of clay as an earthy alternative to an increasingly fluid, chaotic, and �virtual� world.  Or will there be a shift that will affect all of us together?</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>IKATZ/COLBY Do I show my ignorance by questioning the concept of clay art without clay?<br>As a more traditional mud slinger it is the direct contact with material that excites me. Digital technology is just another tool. I am aware that it has, or will have a vast influence on design, but both with my own practice and that of all other potters I have contact with, its direct influence is slight.<br>However its indirect influence is great. This is through the internet by way of eased communication, images and ideas. But the bottom line is, I just want to handle/fondle/caress clay. If this detracts from me being an artist and 'limits' me to being just a potter, then so be it.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Timgee:  I am glad that this issue came out. It is good to have a potter among us in the digital world as well as in our discussion.  The discussion of the digital/elemental influence on ceramic art seems inevitably to bring us to a point where we begin to question the very definition of ceramics as an activity, as a medium, as a way of thinking or being in the world.  This question has implications for the future way that we see the separation of disciplines in art education and art practice.   Is it really possible to conceive of a ceramics without clay?? Could we still call it ceramics??  Whether we say yes or no to these questions, what remains are the facts of what we are doing and where we place ourselves in the world. <p><br>What we make and how we respond to it says something about what we see as our role in the world. There is a division between approaches that seek to connect to what is emerging in our culture and approaches that seek an engagement with process and material that have existed for millennia.  There are areas however where these influences converge. What we are examining is that area of convergence. I think what you are saying is that this convergence occurs in a peripheral area around your work, in areas of communication and calculation, but has a very small effect on the product. This brings me back to the nuts and bolts of the panel.<p><br>As mentioned above I would like each panelist to give a short presentation of what they are doing. The goal of this presentation is to give a visual representation of the work and a brief introduction to the surrounding concepts and influences that lead to the work.  Below I have compiled a list of questions that will be posted to the panelists after the introduction of their work.  I see the introduction as an opportunity for panelists to show the visuals of their work, and influences and to give a context for the answers to the questions. I hope that we can project relevant images during the discussion as well if possible.  What we want to avoid is excessive overlap of content that we will address in the discussion part of the panel.  Below are the a list of questions for the panel to address. If a panelist wants to pass on one of the questions less relevant to their work I don�t see a problem with that.  The goal of the question list is to give the panelists an opportunity to engage the various levels which digital/elemental influences impact their work. If there are some areas missing let's add to the list. If there is excessive overlap lets pair them down.<p>Describe the digital influence and the elemental influence on:<p>-how you make your work.<p>-the intended content of your work<p>-the way you value your work<p>-the way your work is viewed by the audience<br>				<br>-the place your work fits in the social hierarchy<br>				<br>-the overall look and feel of your work<br>				<br>-the development of your work<br>				<br>-unintended content or peripheral meaning<br>				<br>-your way of understanding your role as an artist<br>				<br>-your way of understanding the field of ceramics<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>After looking at the question list it occurs to me that we will not have enough time to go through the whole list during the discussion phase. I think we should cover the most important aspects of process/technical, intent/content, and point out the most important visual aspects in our 10 minute presentations.  Also unless it seems particularly relevant to one of you I think we should take out the issue of social hierarchy.  <p><br>What I am envisioning as an introduction is something like this:<p>�In today�s world, the influence of digital technology affects us in so many ways it is difficult to distinguish how pervasive it is. The question is: "What impact does the influence of a digital world have on artists working in clay?"  This panel offers a microcosm or snap shot of this influence as it plays out in the work of four individuals accessing both elemental and digital references in their work to varying degrees. The panel is focused on only a few responses so there are many valid and interesting directions that are not represented here.  We will begin with short presentations of the primary technical, theoretical, and physical aspects of our work, then engage in a question and answer phase amongst the panelists. The third phase of the panel will open up the discussion to the audience by addressing questions and comments. Members of the audience interested in contributing will be asked to write their questions and comments down to be collected and read by the panelists the author may choose to include their name or remain anonymous. �<br>In order to keep the presentations short and to the point I would like the panelists to work from a prepared statement that includes aspects of process/technical, intent/content, and visual/physical aspects. Let�s limit the number of slides to no more then 15. I would like to save the developmental narrative for the discussion part. Remember this is a panel discussion not a series of lectures so we need to save time for the discussion.<br>As far as the format for questions and answers I would like to have each panelist formulate two or three questions of their own to ask the rest of the panelists. We will then take turns asking questions of the rest of the panel. I think that we will only have enough time for a maximum of three questions each. Follow up questions are desirable to keep the discussion more spontaneous but they would have to be substitutions rather then additions to the question list.<p>The following are my first choice questions:<p>1.	Did you set out to explore a digital influence or did you discover it in your work?<p>2.	Expand a little on how you establish a balance between digital and elemental influences.<p>3.	How do digital and elemental influences affect or relate to the goals you set for yourself in your art practice?<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hey Fred, <p>Thanks for your last two post. The questions that you have raised have helped me to focus on the subject at hand. It was a good idea to see everyone's thoughts. I believe that your intro is very important in the fact that this is just four artist perspectives on the digital influence within their work. Through our brief 10 minute discussions people will be able to see that this new technology is changing the way in which information is disseminated and has allowed us access to information that in the past would be hard to obtain. It has also made us question the future of the world and the future of the art world. Thanks for putting so much time and thought into the discussion. I think we should meet for lunch on Wednesday as a group and toss some of these proposed questions around. <p>Rick</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is a draft of my presentation for NCECA:(some things will definitely be changed based on the fact that I am describing things that will not need to be described in the lecture, since they will be shown on the screen.)<p><br>I want to present a group of my works that fits perfectly into this conversation about digital and elemental influences.  I have been creating mixed media works that combine fired clay with a video image of that fired clay.  In essence showing two versions of the same thing, but using very different mediums.  <br>Each of these pieces incorporates a series of small clay sculptures that are designed like cells in an animation film, with minor sequential adjustments from one to the next.  Displayed alongside the sculptures is a video made using images of these sculptures.  The video, which loops indefinitely, seems to show a simple object involved in a simple motion: growing then receding, rolling left then rolling right, melting then re-forming, etc. <br>Part of the point of these artworks is to give a sense of play.  In making them I let myself play, and that is part of what I want viewers to feel when they see the work.  <br>The other thing I was after, that more directly relates to this discussion, is that I wanted to take some of the sense of movement and plasticity that is there when a piece is being created, and have that kind of energy still there in the finished work.  I was looking at how, particularly in the last hundred years, artists have tried in many ways to give a sense of movement or life to immobile paintings and sculpture.  And while the strategies have often been effective, they generally give a sort of �snapshot� sense of life or motion, rather than strategies that match our experience of actual motion.<br>Now you could say that this work is an exploration of how motion can be expressed artistically in an �elemental� format (clay) versus how it could be expressed in a �digital� format (video).  And the results say a lot to me about the wonderful possibilities within each format, as well as the distinct limits.  So I�m going to juxtapose these two mediums as a way to discuss those limits and possibilities.<br>First there is the clay, with its myriad of associations.  It is elemental in the sense of it�s being tactile, earthy and solid, and for me it also has a fleshy connotation.  It is an ancient medium, having been used by humans to create imagined forms for at least the past 30,000 years.  It is also analog (like any object that is actual, rather than virtual) and has an infinite level of detail.  The closer you get to inspect it, the more you see.  Clay has qualities of depth and texture and ways that it reflects or gathers light that cannot be reliably communicated; and some of which may not even be apparent to someone new to the field.  Elemental suggests something raw and rugged to me, but it also suggests the power of a pure material, like a quartz crystal.  It is physical, and as such can never be precisely duplicated (although a facsimile could be made almost identical, in reality each copy would have unique qualities at some level). Clay is also fully dimensional, meaning that as you move around it, there are subtle changes in what you actually see; different perspectives, different highlights and shadows.  On the other hand, a limitation of the ceramic part of these works is that they are immobile.  Though they can be formed in a way that continues to express a sense of plasticity and movement after they are fired, the fact remains that fired clay cannot be bent or reshaped without breaking it.  <br>Secondly, there is the video, representing digital influences partly because the video I am using IS digital, but also in a broader sense in that it consists of encoded information processed electronically.  Video is clearly very different from clay as a way to present something visually.  It is flat; allowing only one perspective for viewing.  It is limited in terms of detail (the closer you get to the image, the less detail you see).  Because it is digital, identical copies can be easily and precisely reproduced without limit, and the ten thousandth one would be the same as the first.  Compared to clay, video is a tiny infant of a medium.  Television sets have only been available for about 75 years, while video as an art form has only existed for about 30 years, and digital video even more briefly still.  Far from having an ancient lineage, video is just barely emerging from the �gimmick� stage.  It can be flashy and attention-grabbing.  But it is also bright and alive with movement.  This is the strongest quality of video as far as I am concerned.  In my own work, my intention is to use video to give life to inanimate objects.  I see this as an act of technological sorcery; bringing a quality of aliveness to objects that is mesmerizing even when one is entirely aware of the illusion involved.<br>Finally, apart from what each of these mediums brings separately, there is also something that they bring synergistically.  One who has only seen the ceramic sculptures has a sense of their suggestion of movement, but cannot visualize it with full clarity.  One who has only seen the video portion of the work sees the full movement, but cannot experience the rich detail of the material itself. The synergy is that the viewing of one format infects the perception of the other.  Having seen the video, the objects no longer seem as static, but more so as frozen moments.  Having seen the objects, the video seems like a magic trick to which you have just learned the secret.<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><p><br>I would like my presentation to focus on the following:<p>1. Our evolving relationship with technology, specifically our use of new imaging technology, which provides access to the human body through the opacity of the skin. <p>2. Our increased use of code as a primary mode for sharing information, and possible similarities between our use of code and the coded instructions imbedded in the function of Biology and Genetics.  <p>3. What I see as a hybrid between virtual/actual, digital/elemental experience, and my response: to create a synthesis between the two, physically and conceptually.<p>4. My use of multiples and coded information within systems that reveal the organization and evolution of inorganic and organic matter.<p>5. The critical role that ceramics plays in my work as a source of elemental material, a crystalline lattice capable of encoding human experience, structures, and behavior.<br>                        <p>My plan for presentation is use the structure that we have discussed of  Direct  Technical, Direct  Conceptual, and Indirect digital and elemental influences.  I will use images of my work as a vehicle to address the five issues that I have outlined above.<p>Point 1 is a natural starting place for me as the human body is the primary source of imagery in my work. I am exploring developments in the scientific image of the body and the impact imaging technology is having on physical intrusion of the body. I will use examples of my work to explore this change in physical/actual interaction with the body, and non-obtrusive electronic and magnetic scanning which creates a purely visual/virtual data- base for human anatomy. The scientific image floats out of context from medical journals, becoming a continual stream of virtual communication, an immediate source for consumable knowledge. I see this development to be an excellent source for exploring the premise of our digital/elemental discussion. <p>There are interesting convergences in areas of research that are exploring relationships between computer science, molecular biology, chemistry, genetics, crystallography, mathematics, and art�.. With point 2, I would like to present some relationships that have fueled my conceptual thinking. These may be best formed as questions that my work is attempting to respond to.  Does our communicating with code function in a similar way as the primary systems of our origins within a Darwinian model of evolution?  Do computers linked together, live streaming shared code, function like the human genome? I would like this line of thought appropriately tied to examples of my work.<p><p>In point 3,the simultaneity and synthesis of the digital/elemental environment for me is played out in my experience with the human body. I can�t help but to see a relationship between our thoughts, beliefs, and behavior as inseparable from the physical realities of the body.  This is trivialized by using the term MIND-BODY relationship, but for the sake of discussion, I believe that we use the mind to rationalize our coexistence with this 3-dimensional biological machine that we all come to terms with.  I have a very difficult time separating Sculpture from the body, not as imagery, but as issues that explore form, mass, material, tension, compression, and motion.  In fact in the past 20 years, materiality and the object have been deconstructed to the point where video installation, predominately visual/virtual communication, is Sculpture. Yes, I know this is a generalization, but I have often felt that as an Artist committed to material concerns, we as a culture have embraced the dematerial and conceptual as a way of celebrating the human mind as superior to the body. In my work I utilize electronic images of the body, captured from live streaming shared code, and the materiality of clay to replicate systems of solid matter.  This context provides a possible re-evaluation of the relationship between the body (material, physical, elemental), and the constructions of the human mind. <p>Point 4 is straightforward. I make associations to biological systems and structures by using one simple form replicated to produce unlimited complexity through mutation within an evolutionary process.  I am comparing organic systems of biology to inorganic systems in crystallography, which intersects with digital mechanics and our use of binary code.  Working with thousands of multiple forms within this conceptual framework has greatly impacted my studio practice. I give myself over to change through missteps and misspellings in the studio. This moves my work forward incrementally, allowing change to occur. Again, I will use examples of my work to make this point where appropriate.<p>The strict order of the crystalline lattice provides an underlying source of order to my work. Point 5 explores my interest in replicating crystal systems, which is rooted in my knowledge of ceramic materials and process. This is critical to the conceptual development and has greatly influences how my work visually appears. Clay as a self-replicating material provides the core of my material/sculptural concerns. It is the tactile and optical properties of clay, with fusion of glaze as image on form, that creates the physical synthesis between images and form that most influences my work.  The fleeting electronic image becomes a fused solid.  This will be visually apparent the presentation of my work.<p>Of course this is a lot of information. I plan to let images of my work do most of the work and will briefly mention these points. I have provided more information here for the sake of discussion, and assist in making connections. I believe that most of these points will be in the context of the question we will ask each other and the overall discussion. <p><p><p><p><p><p><p>My Three Questions:<p>1. Could you speak to how this topic of digital/elemental has influenced your studio practice?<p><br>2. Could you outline some of the indirect influences that our digitally dominant culture has had on your creative interest?<p><br>3. Is it possible or practical to reject technology and not participate in this digital landscape?<p><p>Fred, are we to set-up are slides using 2 projectors side by side?  If we use that format would it be 15 slides in each projector for a total of 30 slides?<p><br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>In my portion of the presentation I will discuss three main concepts.  The first concept focuses on the primary digital influence on my work, which is research via the Internet.  The second concept is the elemental influence on my work, which is comprised of clay, steel, and salt.  Within this concept, I will further expand on the quality and meaning of these three elements in relation to my work.  The final concept I will introduce is sculpture as a vehicle for research and the role of the artist in society as it relates to new industries. I see my role on this panel as being the elemental voice.<p>My three questions are as follows:<br>1. How is the artist influencing digital technology and how is digital technology influencing the artist?<br>2. As digital technology advances, do the tools of the artist change and what does the studio of the future artist look like?<br>Is it the artist�s role to critique new technologies and do they need to be involved in them to understand them?<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Rick,<p>Thanks for your post. Here is my latest revision and the most complete list of questions so far.<p>For me as with most of us the influence of the elemental precedes that of the digital. In particular clay�s paradoxical qualities of fluid plasticity as in surfing the internet and hard fired structure hold a strong attraction for me. I use the ready-made brick form of clay, a ubiquitous processed commodity, to build in its elemental form. The act of building however is not enough.  How does an elemental desire to build form out of material, relate to my experience of the rest of the surrounding environment?  What kind of response can I have to the visual complexity of a world where image, form, and text is reformatted and repackaged? What if each brick was a pixel or a bit of information? What if these images processed were built into a structure that retained the potential for reformatting? Would I thereby be creating a brick sculpture that becomes virtual? The answer has come in rebuilding various brick structures with glazed images and text, installed in shifting public, educational, and commercial settings. The structures though sometimes large are built of small particles. Although they have mass and solidity they retain a temporal fluid nature. They are made of commercially made products combined with an earthy ceramic process. They incorporate images like bits of perception and in turn become images themselves. Bricks are gleaned over and over again from previous sculptures for a new site, a new viewing audience.  <p>Now that each of us has outlined the general forms that we have produced while �under the influence� we will continue by further questioning the specific and more general impact of the confluence of digital and elemental influences. Let�s begin that phase with some questions from Brian Boldon. <p>-Ideas about what is real?<br>	Talk about the concept of simulation as it relates to your working<br>	Do you see the virtual as being less real then the elemental?<br>	Is there an inherent loss of information in the encoding of the elemental into the digital?<br>	Are you interested in expanding the physical limitations of material by using a digital? <br>format?<br>Do you think that digital influences have altered our sense of reality? If so how?<br>-The relationship of skill of the hand (craft)<br>	Talk a little about how craft enters in to your reconciliation of digital and elemental <br>	How relevant are your processes of making to the content of your work?<br>	How relevant are digital processes to those primarily interested in skill of the hand and <br>process? <br>	How relevant are digital processes to those interested in utilitarian objects?<br>-Ideas about language and the concept of encoding<br>	-How does the construct of language or encoding information enter into your work?<br>	-Would you say that digital technology unites skill and intellect in your work? If so how?<br>	-Does the use of digital technology instill a new level of content in your work or facilitate <br>previous aspects of meaning?<br>-Talk a little about how concepts specific to digital technology beyond the tools used are <br>important to your work?<br>-How does the way that you integrate digital/elemental relate to the way you integrate <br>influences of the body with influences of the mind?<br>-How do concepts of memory, formatting, saving, copying, pasting, undoing, burning a disc, layering, erasing, files, e-mail, networks, input, output, imaging, animation, selecting, scanning, resolution, loading, exporting, acquiring, plug ins, installation, display, preview, launching, and other computer related terms enter into your work? <br>-What does a digital/physical consciousness look like? (a state where coded information intermingles with sense and memory information)<br>	-Describe the elemental equivalent to code in the digital world?<br>	-Does the digital/elemental dichotomy follow the same pattern as other dichotomies such as <br>contemplative/utilitarian, art/craft, concept/form, innovation/tradition, culture/nature?<br>-How does the idea of progress enter into the discussion of a digital/elemental influence?<br>-How does digital media impact our ideas of public and private aspects of art?<p>-Tools used  <br>	Describe briefly some of the digital tools you use in making your work<br>	Has the use of the computer altered the look and feel of your work or simply made it <br>easier to execute?<br>-Talk a little about the influence of photographic processes enter into our discussion of the <br>digital?<br>-The future of your work<br>	What strategies are you planning to pursue in the future to integrate digital/elemental?<br>	What new paradigms for making and showing work does the digital/elemental confluence <br>suggest?	<br>-As clay workers don�t we have a responsibility to propagate the elemental aspects of material and craft?<br>-The impact of digital/elemental influences on the field of ceramics<br>	How do you see the digital impacting the teaching of ceramics in the colleges and universities <br>of today?<br>Do you think that the influence of the digital is a force for the dissolution of disciplinary <br>boundaries and are you in favor of such a dissolution?<br>What is your vision for an integrated digital/elemental ceramic education of the future?<br>Do you think that digital influences are affecting the way we define ceramics as a medium?<br>How does the integration of digital media open up new possibilities for collaboration with <br>other disciplines in art and beyond?<br>-Is it imperative that we take up these tools or can we rely on our past traditions?<br>-Do you envision a ceramics that goes fully virtual, beyond the object or is objecthood part of the criteria that defines a ceramic work?<br>-Do you feel that ceramic practice is in need of revision to account for the influence of digital technology on our culture?<br>-The effect on the way that we value work<br>Does the use of digital tools have an inherent effect on the value of the work that you <br>produce?<br>	Which do you value more in your work the digital or the elemental influence?<p>-Power issues<br>	-How does the issue of access to technology effect who has control over the digital influence? <br>	-Are significant segments of artists marginalized because they do not have access to digital <br>technology? <br>	-What does the use of technology say about our position in the social hierarchy?<br>	-How do the processes forms and content of your work support a political agenda?<br>-Audience<br>	-How does the use of digital tools affect the audience that the work is directed toward?<br>	-Do you think that your audience needs specialized knowledge to appreciate your work?<br>	-Does the use of digital tools widen your audience or shrink it?<br>	-What kind of society would welcome your work?<br>	-What needs and desires does your work serve?<br>	-How does the digital influence affect the way that the audience understands ceramic objects?<br>-Context<br>	-Can you give some examples of specific influences from digital/elemental context?<br>	-Is it possible to ignore digital influences in our work and precede as if they weren�t there?<br>	-How does your work represent your experience of the world you live in?<br>	-How has an economic environment increasingly centered around the processing of <br>information rather then the manufacture of objects impacted your work?<br>-How has the increase in access to technical, historical, and contemporary information<br>affected your products or processes?<br>-Your role as an artist <br>	-Do digital/elemental influences affect your sense of your role as an artist?<br>	-Do digital/elemental influences change your concept of what an artist does in the world?<br>	-How does your work critique or support previous conventions and traditions?<br>	-What commitments and investments have you put in to your work? (lifestyle, financial)<br>	-Do you see yourself as contributing to a scientific-technological inquiry?<br>	-How does art differ from scientific research?<br>	-What is the link between visual and digital culture?<p>Closing:<br>As stated at the outset we inhabit an age where digital and elemental influences are all around us. Ultimately what we do with them says something about who we are and how we interact with the world.  In dealing with both the digital and elemental, the best work will be generated with a playful approach and a necessary involvement of practice.  <br></FONT></td></tr></table></center><p><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><CENTER><A HREF="/cgi-local/postings.cgi?action=newtopic&number=5&forum=Culture"><IMG SRC="/ubb/topic5.jpg" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0 ALT="Post New Topic"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="/cgi-local/postings.cgi?action=reply&forum=Culture&number=5&topic=000006.ubb&TopicSubject=Under+The+Influence+Digital/+Elemental"><IMG SRC="/ubb/reply5.jpg" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0 ALT="Post Reply"></A></CENTER></TD>
