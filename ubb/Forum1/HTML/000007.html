</FONT><HR>Toby Risman sent this to me, so I've posted it here. Forrest<p>I am a 55 year old American potter. I was influenced by teachers in Mass. who had read Leach. I read Leach in the 70's when I was looking for an alternative to teaching music to people who didn't want to learn. I am still pottingand still struggling with the issues of cost, function, form(currently trying to perfect the teapot spouts I make) poking fun of pots as art and I have been to Japan, just discussed issues of Mingei, tea ceremony, wood fired aesthetics, etc I made a "pilgrimage to the Leach studio in 73.I was disappointed in the work being produced. I visited Mr. Yasuda's studion in 87 and was impressed with the work being produced. Prices always seemed high. No one was anonymous.     John Maltby was complaining that his work was much more attractive to the Japanese than at home in England. Issues of aesthetics as well as a desire to try to sense why the Japanese found pots to be valuable unlike my customers, influenced  a trip to Japan in 1991.  I learned that there was plenty of well made under and overpriced pottery in Japan and that the hype around specific studios was a way of keeping some people in the money but many out of it. It is no different in the west. Galleries often determine the value of work. Skill in marketing helps alot.I have just been to the ACC show in San Francisco where pottery was the cheapest craft, though many had prices I in the "middle class" could no longer afford. Clearly potters want a living wage. That often makes their work a luxury item. And thus the affordable concept goes out the window and we are back to being in a quandary as to the value of making it, for ourselves or to keep culture from losing the ability to use, feel, appreciate hand made products produced by members of our own culture for our culture. It all gets mixed up unless we are supported by the state to create craft or art and that is another can of worms.  England has I dare say more money for that than the U. S. Other European countries have support systems for craft and the arts. In California we have the community colleges by don't tell anyone or they will cut our budgets further... And on that note I go to create dinner for 8.. Toby Risman  PS. Thank you for creating this forum and for the astute discussion so far.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
