</FONT><HR>I wanted to move Jeff's first post over to this topic. Here's his message:<p>posted 10-04-2003 10:19 AM ET (US) ��� ���� �� <br>I think the surface treatment should be a natural one applied over time. Fire the clay body to the color you desire cone 04 for example and then set the work outside in a "cemetery garden" to get that natural patina. Whether it is an urban or rural setting the forces of the environment can provide an interesting surface. It is not a quick finish, but could be a satisfying surface.<p>Sincerely, Jeff <p></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Surface treatment may depend upon Forrest's intentions.  Say for example, there were an element of humor in the epitaphs, then a boisterous approach to glazing might add to the effect.  Ideally, the glazing would enhance some aspect of the overall mood of the piece.  A natural appearence would probably add a solemn note.  Maybe something playful might be indicated by some eptiaphs - it depends.  For some reason, Robert Arneson's pieces come to mind when thinking about glazing.  They were fairly literal, usually.<p>One aspect of these pieces that greatly appeals to me is the potential for a "literary" aspect of a ceramic work of art.  It would seem possible that the text of the epitaph would offer HUGE potential for experimentation.<p>These appear to be masterfully crafted.  So masterful that I bet most viewers would initially believe them to be genuine grave markers rather than a work of sculpture.<p>I think Forrest has a great idea so far.  I hope that he can use this series of work to make some personal statement beyond mere homage to the grave marker.  On that level the pieces work very well.  If the work also had some humor, or dramatic flair, or political commentary, they would be well over the top.<p>Cone 04?   If these are intended for outdoors, better watch out for freezing & thawing.  It would be a shame to see them self destruct over a few years time.<p>just my $.02...<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Dribbly drippy glossy -green, yellow, blue, purple... tang dynasty funearyware?! conection with past practces and past craftsmen mat be a way to step back from the pure "realistic" copy and streetch the concept  of the peice?? Though lively glazing on those extremely static forms may be just too contradictory or visually challenging. What about infering age ie lichens and rust and deterioration/passage of time. At the moment they look pristine and new without the softening and "elegance" of passing time and exposure and wear. Just my 2 cents!!</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Exciting stuff!<p>If your goal is to "remind the viewer of something or someplace other", then either your surface treaments should help convey that or the treatments should not get in the way.<p>Adding moss like effects with rain erosion may refer to one type of place, where as adding only wind errosion refers to some place else.  (Luster may put it in another place entirely.)  On the contrary, you could keep it a plain surface, with the idea that the shape and the words alone are to convey, perhaps a more universal, meaning.<p>Mattm rightly notes, the textual portion of the piece allows for a large amount of possibilities. This is something that I am researching on my web log (john-norris.net.)  As you know, but there are many symbols and phrases that grave stones use to convey information as well...something more to play with (I refer to John Cramer's email archived at http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/GENMTD/1998-08/0903625591.)<p>John<br>john-norris.net<br>Art, Information, Ceramics, and You<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Grave stones executed well though I would expect to see some weathering given the dates. Perhaps some slip/stain application or oil/acrylic effects after firing. In the "raw" state they feel too clean. May want to create some broken ones.<br>Suggest exhibiting them as an environment. Grouping them, perhaps as "families" with other objects one might find in a cemetary (dying flowers).<br>My first thoughts of names/inscriptions is with the introduction of humor & satire.

</FONT><HR>Forrest the use of the headstone is an excellent and thought provoking image.What you want to do with the surface treatment will depend on the objective for a particular piece.Furthermore what about the epitaph itself? Is it going to literally be about fictional characters/personages(?) or could it be a statement on our<br>cultural,social and/or political ideas.The tombstone is a marker of our linear history.More interestingly, how can you convey a non-linear timeless concept within this framework? Is it possible? All aspects including surface treatment help to convey your intent, it just depends on how important that aspect is to you and the piece.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am not bothered by the uneweathered surface as I know these are not really old tombstones and faking it doesn't always work for me.  Also I am always looking for the unexpected and an aged surface would just be too predictable in this case.   I really wanted to be able to read all the fine print and was only able to read this on one of the pieces.  This was the one for Cony Earle. (I hope I have that right) The face on the top of the tombstone and the text at the bottom - something about a sweet rose whose odor is now vile - really worked together for a sense of humor.  Now to know the text on the others.....</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for all of the feedback. You've given me a lot to think about. So much, in fact, that I had been typing for 45 minutes when my d*mn computer crashed!!! Auuugh! I can't believe it. So, I can't repeat all that. I'll keep it short this time...<p>The epitaphs are important. The text adds (I hope) a whole dimension to the work. Edwin Brash's reads:<p>The Reaper's ground<br>I'd helped to till<p>A lonely sound<br>The hole to fill<p>Beneath this mound<br>My body still<p>Death came round<br>Against my will.<p>One thing I'm wonder is if it's important that they be life sized? What if they were in minature (8"-12")? Super sized (6')?<p>Also, my thoughts with glazing/surface are concerned with how can I add yet another layer of information to these pieces. Perhaps something unexpected, like using the drippy Tang Dynasty like glaze. What do I think about something that is so obviously not a real tombstone, but references real ones very closely in some ways and also points me to a past (dead?) culture? <p>The thing I love about old tombstones and graveyards is the stories, and for me they are stories, not histories. They leave one with plenty of space to imagine the details. <p>I want to post this before I loose it... More later.<p>Forrest</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>HI Forrest - I just breezed thruough the comments. <p>I agree with the last statement - leave the surfaces as they are. The interest here lies in the fact that this is not what you would expect from a gravestone. <p>Also, have you considered leaving the pieces unfired? It may be cheesy - but I think of life as a non-permanent thing and clay is one of the best materials use when working with the idea of non-permanence vs permanence. Or, firing the gravestone, and keeping the "pedastal" piece unfired. <p>Play with placement. I can  remember the really old graveyards that I have visited. Many of the stones are no longer standing, and some have been buried so that just a little of it is unexposed and the rest is sunken into the ground covered by grass. Fragments, or toppled over new looking stones might be errie. Also playing with context; creating a graveyard in a gallery situation. </FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My response to this work is that firstly, it is impeccably crafted and it is a convincing representation of its influences and sources.  The work is compelling and engaging.<p>However, upon deeper examination,  I do find the work to be somewhat cold and distant; connected as much as an observer would be to any object.  My feeling is that these objects are not connected  to a specific experience other than the viewing of similar objects in their environment.   So for me the question is, how will they function in a gallery setting, if that is where they are intended to be shown? What message are they intended to convey?<p>For me, this work evokes the memory of my own personal experiences that are most likely similar to those of the artist...  memories of viewing gravestones in their environment (i.e.. the graveyard) and creating imaginary narratives about the lives of the persons that are described on the headstones.  <p>I think that a less conventional glaze treatment could serve to push this work in a less conventional direction thusly taking the viewer to place they have not yet been.  I believe that the work is already conventional and literal enough in its representation, certainly the surface will serve to reinforce the artistic intent... I think recreating the sense of aged stone is too literal.  Rather than recreating what has already been seen, what other options exist in the mind of the maker?</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Unless I have a semi-permanent place for them, I doubt these pieces will be taken for gravestones marking real people.  Especially in a gallery setting, they'll be assumed to be works of art, right? Context is always important, as is intent. My intent is to get the viewer to create their own story for the person named on the monument - to help people get to another time/place. What I'm unclear on is whether a 'like real' look helps this process along or hinders it. For sure, all kinds of potentials exist. A whole set of 'ifs'. I guess I could display them in a stone cutters display room. Or a gallery. Or in a traffic median. Or on a roof top. </FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I believe art deals with ideas and craft deals with process.<br>What type of grave markers are you looking at?<br>what were they origianaly made of?<br>I think there is a history of terracotta headstones, but I cannot say this for certain, someone like Carey Esser who runs the Kansas City Art institute ceramics program would be a good rescourse to find out more.<br>But the question I ask myself is, Why is this artist making them in clay, is it because they do not want to work in stone, or wood? And/or it is because clay is available? How does working in clay work to your advantage with this Idea?<br>You ask �How is the narrative changed with different surface treatments??�<br>I think the narrative changes with the fact that it is on a head stone. a grave marker, the idea of death and loss is touched upon, how does that affect the story??<br>I think it is time to not worry so much about the materials and make sure your idea comes through well.<br>On another note you say these 4 stones are not compleated.<br>I think this is a throwback to the pottery days.<br>In school we looked at so many pots bone dry. It was never till the end that we delt with the glaze and surface, it was all about form.  And this is a failing of comming from a pottery background.  <br>I for one do not know why one would ask to critique unfinished work. <br>Stay true to your original idea.<br>IDEA IS KING<br>Like writing, character development is great but you have to have a compelling story to keep the reader interested.<br>What is your story??<br>As to how the glaze will affect the message, that is like someone asking me how they look in a certain outfit.<br>It is all subjective.<br>How do you feel about the runny drippy glaze vs a dry matt glaze??<br>When we MAKE, we are the only ones we should be dealing with.  After it is done then it is open to interpretation.  Unless it is a commision.<br>Just remember, you are creating a personal language to speak the messages/ideas/concepts that you wish to convey.<br>As I reread this, I see I have come off a little harsh, and I am interested in what the moderator has to say about my post.  Harshness is not my intenet.<p>Donn Buchfinck</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>an interesting concept here is that you are making a sculpture (and a rather literal one at that) of a hand crafted item.  there's a great tradition of this in ceramics in the form of non-functional pottery or decorative pottery.  there are thousands of examples of pottery forms that have been reduced to sculpture that you might want to take some inspiration from.  clay sculptors tackled a problem quite similar to this one when they started making pottery specifically for non-utilitarian usage (display in galleries, etc.).  i would assume that one could make a few generalizations regarding qualities found in the surfaces of non-utilitarian pottery that discern it from utilitarian pottery.  if you choose to do some research to look at this idea this you might also be able to make some type of commentary about that particular genre of ceramic art.<p>don't forget - these things already have a surface.  just 'cause it's there doesn't mean you got to put glaze on it.  if it wasn't an important part of your original idea maybe you should just leave it as it is.  and plan the next ones around a more comprehensive idea.<p>by the way, i think it's critical to have input form your peers during the creative process.  thanks for letting us see your unfinished work.  it looks great.  where can we see it when it's finished?<p>mike flaherty</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>It seems feedback from the moderator has been requested.  I am at your service- but as stated earlier - comments should come from  the participants of the site. <br>Regarding the last statement posted by bayareartist- asking if the reponse was too harsh-I don't feel it was harsh. I think that interesting questions were brought into play- for example- why are these objects being made in clay-and exactly what story is being developed through epitaphs etc. I look forward to further discussion about these issues.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Getting back to a point or two made by Donn Buchfinck, I think there is great value in looking at work in progress. For one, I can have feedback from others about new, important, ideas and it's not too late to incorporate them. I really can't see how one SHOULD make in isolation as you imply. Isn't art all about communication of one form or another? If that's so, then maybe the pieces are done now in that they've gotten us to talk about them, death, stories, surface, form, etc. Of course, it's really never too late in the conventional sense, as there's always room to make more. <p>On another note, I sure haven't left the surface considerations to last. Indeed, even before I completed the form of the first gravestone, I had made and bisqued 1200 test tiles. I've got roughly one dozen base glazes to test! So, you see, the thoughts of surface have informed the FORM all along! Donn, when you say IDEA IS KING, you really sound addiment. I used to believe this, too. Now, I know that my mind and body, my interior and the exterior (world) have their own conversation going all the time and work (sometimes fight) together in making. I would never want to loose one for the other. <p>To Blake and others, I haven't dismissed the idea of unglazed headstones, either. One thing I've thought about is sandblasting them or super low bisquing and then taking a high pressure water washer to them. Erasing part of the obvious story, but perhaps adding something else?</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My personal opinion is, �rarley anything good comes out of a commitie.� I know I spelled that wrong.<br>I do not think art needs to be made in isolation, I think we need friends, and people to talk about art to. <br>But I find most contemporary art not that compelling,<br>A lot of stuff out in the world needs complex discriptions to go with the stuff to expalain what it is, setting the viewer up, so to say, not just letting the viewer have a personal experience with the art.<br>Now I have gone beyond the critique in question.<br>I find with a lot of clay, people focus on the process of the making, and not enough on the IDEA that is being conveyed.<br>this is all a broad generalization, I know.<br>I guess what I am trying to say is<br>�Have confidence in what you are doing, DO IT. Don�t ask people if it is good.�  If you are true to yourself that truth will come through in the work.<br>It�s like the harley davidson question, if you have to ask the people why they ride a hog, well you will never know.<br>I mean take a stand, Fake confidence in your art if you have to, Someone has to believe in it, it might as well be you to begin with.<p>How about this, I have the thousand year rule.<br>Pretend someone a thousand years from now has dug up something of yours, they might not know our language, our history, our intent. But does the thing hold it�s own?<br>Is it compelling?<br>Think of what we look at from antiquity. Cycladic figurines, old grave markers, mimbres pottery, that had to do with death, A hole punched in a dish to let the spirit escape. That is real, that has a connection to a society, it speaks of a ritual.<p>The question is �how is what you are making a connection to you, how does it speak the message you wish to convey but also give the essence of truth of  Forrest Snyder?�<p><br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Forest, with your passion for testing glazes and your interest in the relationship between ideas about death and the stories gravestones tell, I'm wondering what thoughts you have concerning these stories, and how sculptural embellishments tell them. Would they be a place to incorporate a variety of glazes that might reflect your sense of history? For example, if you created an aged look, it might show your own distance from the story, and if you incorporated techniques that are located in another time than the years on your marker, would that give you a forum to explore how history is mediated by critical thinking through time? From what I've read of your intent, both conceptually and technically, I am interested in seeing how you continue incorporating  glazes and surface decoration in these works. I like the unglazed softness of your sculpture's surfaces in the images of your work that you have posted, especially the way they work with the careful symmetry and strength they have formally. Best to you, Nita<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hi Forrest,<br>I can only see the first image.  clicking on the image did not result in a new display.  but I will respond based on what I've experienced.  I know the feeling of visiting an old grave yard.  It's many things:  a feeling of connectedness, loss, history, future, the beauty of the surroundings.  I enjoy the repetition of the forms and the variation;  the sweet simplicity of some, especially children's stones and the over the top extravagance of the grief of others.  Each stone has a name and I imagine the individual.  By focusing on the surface and doing all those glaze tests you may have lost track of what was coompelling about the original experience.<br>Donna<br>t</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm interested in that you choose to use pinhole photography instead of other photographic recording methods. In this initial response to your subject matter you were very specific and unique in your visualization. The pinhole camera distorts both perspective and tonal qualities. But the work you have presented here you seem to have approached the work in a very conventional manner. Perhaps there is a clue in your original photographic inspiration, both in surface and form. I'm not convinced that these pieces are completely in service to your intent as they could be. </FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>These pieces are beautifully crafted to be quite literal representations of grave markers.  But not being in a graveyard, they do not conjure thoughts of past lives (for me) though they do speak of death.  Instead, I find myself looking for clues that might reveal Forrest's deeper artistic intent.  I seek these clues in the text, relationship between the pieces, their placement and surroundings. (I realize that some of these cannot be adequately communicated on-line).  At present, there is some ambiguity here as the work is not yet complete and Forrest is still formulating his ideas and intent.  Once these gel, the ideal method of completing the work may reveal itself.<p>DeBorah Goletz</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Man, Kevin's response got me thinking. I'm not sure I agree, but I AM thinking! The short answer as to why I used a pinhole camera is that I like to understand stuff (especially tools that I might use in making art) and I had to dumb down my tool enough so I could get it. In this case, the tool included the developing in a portable darkbox that I carried in the trunk of my car. Anyhow, this is off subject... I think that many of you have pointed out the failing I have recognized, but not stated until now. What is the story for each of these markers? What is their story as a group? Does the group tell something more than just the sum of the individuals? I'm thinking about sets, now. Or at least groups of similar (ceramic) objects. Oh, god, and I thought I was going to get some sleep tonight...</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Okay, just perused what was said previously.  The question or questions that I bring to you is...What is it that makes us so special and unique as people?  And why is that fingerprint evident in our gravemarkers?  They reduce us to being part of "the crowd" which is a whole other pheonomenon.  Each person whether with blonde hair, red, or black.  The unique passions and dislikes of us as individuals.  Could they be reflected through each piece?  The one that was put in the text about Edwin Brash.  What does that really say about that person besides when it was done he filled a hole in the ground?<p>When in school I remember a funerary assignment that was to build a sarcophagus.  My friend was terribly afraid of tight spaces and one side of it had an opening like a can of sardines.  Just for a sculptural example.  <p>But...do you want to speak about these people at all as individuals or as a crowd. The idea of placing them together like when we all lose that identity and become "the crowd" or since you are making them can their own identity transcend through your making of their stone.  What about Ethel Cummings who died a ripe old blue hair who liked to shop on ebay and collect butterfly figurines and happens to have a shoe fettish and love her little poodle named noodle?  Or the hob-nobby socialite who enjoys golf, going to the cigar bar with his buds and collects rare antiquities...the "Frazer" of us...that died of coronary artery disease from too much French food.  Hey, knew a guy just a few years ago would take you on his donkey through the back woods in Pennsylvania  to do some real "coon hunting!"  So WHO are these characters. Just a thought.  So goes to show you left me dying for more.  he he  and...I too share your affinity for graveyards.  </FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Forrest- can you elaborate on the stories you want to tell througn these markers?<br>Also- I've been thinking about the markers- what about the primary and secondary contours of them? The primary contour can stays the same hard edged geometric shape - but surface or secondary contour can be carved from, stacked tightly with applied or carved objects etc to fill the space and present the viewer with part of the story being told-giving us information about the person being represented by the marker.  This could be anything from the tools used by the person, vocation held  or other objects from the period in which the person lived.  Robert Arneson played with this primary/secondary contour in a show of his about war. He displayed a war missile and from a distance you could see a missile but as you approached the piece it became evident that the missile form was actually a mound of bodies. This was a very powerful image to say the least- and it told a dreadful story.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Forrest,<p>Because this work is life scale perhaps you would try them in a garden with a pathway to direct the viewer around the work.  If it was intended to live indoors, I think works on paper would inhance/reinforce the stones, something that was actual (or referenced) gravestone rubbings.  The rubbings could be partially rubbed (or rubbed out) like lives of the dead.  You have a tremendous opportunity to work with text.
