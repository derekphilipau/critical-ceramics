</FONT><HR>I think within the contect of ceramic art, we need a new theory and some new ideas that is reflective of our sources of inspiration.  Whatever is approach ends up being, I think that it needs to be a theory that is based upon a broader scope than twentieth century Western art history has afforded us.  <p>In other words, I believe that a new craft theory should be established from the basis that our work is created from the influence of "world culture", not just the development of western art, beginning with Greek and Roman civilization.<p>As a point of reference, I am attracted to the study of material culture because it unifies my definitions of art beyond post modernism.  As we define the impact of the work of art in world beyond postmodernism, I believe we should ask if the object produced by the artist holds up or not.  <p>As in the study of material culture, we should not depend solely on critical writing or an artist�s statement to support an artwork�s existence.   Its cultural relevance should be substantiated by the object's relevance to the culture in which it was produced rather than the theoretical �post �facto aesthetic intent� of the artist that created it or the critic who is interpreting it.  <p>Since the word �art� has some many meanings in our culture, I must define that my ideas tend to focus on the tangible, handmade art object.  The basis of my assumptions are that objects created by human beings become increasingly important the further technology takes us way from the tangible experience.  <p></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I had just posted a response to Jeff's thougth in the reVIEWs section and then stumbled on this posting.  Although I am entering this discussion rather late, I hope that Jeff, Dennis and others are still checking.  <p>First, here is my initial posting: "Getting back to the initial question, theories help develop understanding. This holds true for ceramics. As understanding of the medium itself developes so should the theory surrounding it. Although form and technique is also important, it is separate from theory - one can learn to throw and fire a form but never consider how other cultures (for example) have approached that same form or process. As a result, I do think that there is real value in a craft theory. I also believe that there is corresponding value to learning from art theory (regardless of whether or not the craft and art have the same "root"). Expression through the medium of clay need not be a "bastard step-child" nor divorsed from the larger craft or art worlds. However, ceramics does require it's own understanding - its own language - and therefore its own theory. I look forward to continueing this discussion."<p>That said, I was more than happy to read Dennis's posting.  I think Dennis raises some interesting issues.  As can be seen, our point of view seems to be similar.  <p>However, I would ask this:  If we should look to material culture as means of substantiating the handmade objects of today, what distinctions should be made between object types.  For example, should we consider a John Glick or Warren MacKenzie bowl/pitcher/mug the same way we consider a piece by Toshiko Takaezu or Ron Nagle or for that matter, the same way we consider an Alvo Altar or Shaker chair?  <p>I look forward to continueing this discussion.<br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Most certainly there need be a unified theory of craft. How else can the field of craft gain pairity with that of the fine arts? (if that is a desired end, from the complaints i have heard it seems to be the case) though there need be a theory for more relavant reasons. Firstly, theory helps acquaint the public with the dialogue, which for the most part the public is uninvolved with art world discourse. Secondly, theory assists in creating a dialogue surrounding the work of art. That is, theory aids in shedding light into the darkness of the art works metaphysical self. Theory elevates the work of art beyond its physical self and into the realm of interpretation. That is, afterall where we approach it, is it not? <p>Besides all that, the question is not whether or not we need craft theory? it is already there, all it needs is to be pulled in and brought into the "unconcealed" we call our lifeworld. A unified theory could help get over the whole art/craft debate, and bring us into a new era of criticism. <p>Though i think we shall find that craft and art do not have the same root��they fulfill different needs or places within existence. That is, craft and art are not the same. Though this should not be mistaken for privileging one over the other, they are different.</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>So, back to Jeff's question ... yes, we need some sort of theory ...<p>But how should the theories of craft and art of ceramics be taught?  The largest pitfall is that theory is subject to interpretation and therefore risks becoming an amorphous unsteady topic leading nowhere.  <p>I have read a large part of a book called "theories of modern art" which is a collection of thoughts by many of the most prolific fine artists of the 20th century.  No one piece is conclusive, but taken together the book is very enlightening.  <p>As for ceramics, how can a professor learn from other disciplines and further dialoge and instruction in the complamentary theories of the craft and art of ceramics?  Is it enough to read about the lives and work of A. Robineau, G. Ohr, S. Hamada, B. Leach, R. Arnison, and P. Voulkos among others or must there be a more active dialogue (similar to the downtown NYC gatherings of the abstract expressionests in the 1950s or Black Mountain College)?  <br></FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>In an effort to start the new year on a "philosophical" note... I want to quote a sentence from a recent Ceramics: Art & Perception.   Robert Nelson, describing the history of ceramics states that <p>"...the appreciation of ceramics has receded to the popular, to bourgeois decoration, a cut above crockery, perhaps received by a dedicated cabinet, but not over-endowed with philosophical virtue."  <p>In light of our previous discussions on the need for a theory, how do you respond to this?<p>I also think this observation relates well to the John Brits letter.  <p>Happy New Year to all!  </FONT></td></tr></table></center><p><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><CENTER><A HREF="/cgi-bin/postings.cgi?action=newtopic&number=6&forum=Open+Forum"><IMG SRC="/ubb/topic5.jpg" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0 ALT="Post New Topic"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/postings.cgi?action=reply&forum=Open+Forum&number=6&topic=000025.ubb&TopicSubject=craft+theory"><IMG SRC="/ubb/reply5.jpg" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0 ALT="Post Reply"></A></CENTER></TD>
