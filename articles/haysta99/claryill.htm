TALKING WITH CLARY ILLIAN</FONT>

In between answering student&#146s questions, checking on a problematic kiln and preparing for a lobster boat trip, Iowa potter Clary Illian spoke to Forrest Snyder of Critical Ceramics on the deck outside the pot shop at Haystack. 
</P>

<P>
CC: I attended the SOFA exhibition in NYC recently. The crafts and presentation were very sophisticated and refined; arriving at Haystack this morning provides quite a contrast. Would you ever consider doing a show like SOFA?
</P>
<P>
CI: God, no! First of all, I would never be asked...
</P>
<P>
CC: One of the things that struck me was that folks were buying $20,000 pieces simply to match the decor in their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
CI: As you&#146re saying that, it occurs to me that when people come into my show room, and say things like, &#147I only have warm tones in my kitchen...&#148, I&#146m actually not offended because I have a wide range of shapes and traditional glazes. So, it seems to me, that if they add in another piece within my parameters, it&#146s really not so terribly offensive. When it comes down to sheer utility, I don&#146t mind those kinds of demands.
</P>
<P>
CC: Does that mean you&#146re willing to create pieces with specific glazes to meet customer&#146s requests?
</P>
<P>
CI: It&#146s not like I&#146m going to turn around and do exactly what they request, but I might suggest that &#147a black might look nice or a white porcelain.&#148
</P>
<P>
CC: When those folks come in and say here&#146s what I&#146m looking for and why, doesn&#146t that influence you? Several years later, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
CI: You&#146ve hit on an interesting area that I&#146ve never tried to explore. That is the whole market driven, top-down, attempt to get people to buy a whole new group of things because something is &#147in&#148 that year. No. I would never respond to that.
</P>
<P>
CC: What if you were determining what was &#147in&#148 that year?
</P>
<P>
CI: If I were queen, I would say that my range would never be that narrow because it wouldn&#146t be market driven. It would be driven on the basis of excellence.
</P>
<P>
CC: Isn&#146t part of excellence getting the work out there?
</P>
<P>
CI: First of all, I think that the people who say they are making utilitarian pots are at the service of utility. As far as the aesthetics of the pots, we are educators. We are not to be led around by our noses. We are the ones who have to take responsibility. And I think it&#146s entirely doable because the people who buy crafts really like to have personal contact with the maker. 
</P>
<P>
CC: That&#146s exciting and provides the opportunity for education of the maker and buyer alike, don&#146t you think?
</P>
<P>
CI: I find that when customers come to me with a very specific need - say an oil lamp burner or a garlic dish - and nothing else, what they really want to do is feel involved in the creative process. If I were to be candid with them, I&#146d say, &
#147Look. I&#146ve got bowls of every shape and size. Covered containers of every shape and size. It&#146s all here!&#148
</P>
<P>
CC: So, the customer&#146s demands do seem offensive?
</P>
<P>
CI: I try to convey to them that I&#146m on a passionate quest. Then they get it, &#147Oh, she&#146s making utilitarian pots, but it&#146s a journey. It&#146s a quest.&#148
</P>
<P>
CC: In a sense, by selling them a pot, you&#146re including them in on a few steps of that journey?
</P>
<P>
CI: Exactly. I&#146m saying, &#147Come along with me.&#148
</P>
<P>
CC: Do you have techniques for hooking people without the verbal education?
</P>
<P>
CI: I think the technique is not even a technique. They must live with one of the pieces for a while. I think we have a great affinity for what is familiar to us.
</P>
<P>
CC: Given that, do you think there&#146s a uniformity occurring in potters around the world?
</P>
<P>
CI: I think what&#146s happening is that the regional looks are no longer actually regional. That is, they&#146re no longer geographically based. They are choices makers make. Choices of affinity. They enjoy communities of formal interests.
</P>
<P>
CC: Is that based on experience?
</P>
<P>
CI: It&#146s based on affinity, as I said, and then it&#146s based on who your teacher was.
</P>
<P>
CC: In learning, what do you think about copying a teacher&#146s work versus making one&#146s own work?
</P>
<P>
CI: We&#146ve been talking a lot about this in the workshop. I really like to stress to the students that as they are going through this learning experience that when they borrow, they can borrow the generic underpinnings. They must be careful to discern between these generic underpinnings and all of the little grace notes that comprize style so that when you come to the surface of your pot, don&#146t make Suze Lindsay&#146s lines for example. Invent all those grace notes that push personal stylization.
</P>
<P>
CC: That&#146s hard...
</P>
<P>
CI: It&#146s super hard!
</P>
<P>
CC: Do you see recognizable signs that a student&#146s &#147getting it&#148 and is ready to flip from copying into their own?
</P>
<P>
CI: One of the bad things about graduate education is that it teaches us all to have really good raps about what we&#146re doing. It has to start with copying to develop hand-eye skills. Beyond that, the inexperienced maker might say, &#147Am I going to do Michael Simon fish, today?&#148 Or am I going to ask, &#147Do I actually have any fish in my life? Well, no. What references do I have that are more central to my own life?&#148 It always feels forced to begin with. You have to do them a while to own them.
</P>
<P>
CC: Do you need regular contact with your potter peers?
</P>
<P>
CI: Not so much anymore. I think that heaven is having a discussion with a peer with an interesting mind. Someone like Mary Baringer. Also, coming here, I like seeing what&#146s going on in the other disciplines. I think with Leach training I have an incredible foundation. I have not looked to the outside to grow. I&#146ve always looked inside.
</P>
<P>
CC: That seems to be the break, in some ways, between student and artist.
</P>
<P>
CI: Especially in American students, there&#146s a feeling like &#147there must be one more educational opportunity that will give me that perfect sense of self confidence.&#148 
</P>
<P>
CC: What&#146s exciting about teaching at Haystack?
</P>
<P>
CI: Not only seeing people make giant leaps, but trying to figure out the teaching part of it. How can I more and more clearly verbalize what they need. I enjoy that.
</P>
<P>
CC: You don&#146t have a pat routine, then?
</P>
<P>
CI: I have a routine in the sense of what I assign them. When I do crits it&#146s like making rounds - I&#146m the head doctor and I&#146m putting people on the spot. I know that people are going to present with certain clusters of bad habits and certain abilities to see - which they already have - but they&#146re not paying attention and nobody&#146s unlocked for them.
</P>
<P>
CC: So, the pot is a catalyst for this great discussion?
</P>
<P>
CI: Certainly. And the observation. Then there&#146s the student who doesn&#146t do what I tell them anyhow and makes a perfectly wonderful pot. I love that!
</P>
<P>
CC: That insolence doesn&#146t make you angry?
</P>
<P>
CI: No, because it&#146s interesting to me. Why is it working? Then I want to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
CC: What gets you going in your own studio?
</P>
<P>
CI: It&#146s not so mental. It&#146s a task. The more pots I make, the more of a task it is. I tend to throw for five or six weeks before I bisque.
</P>
<P>
CC: Do you keep a schedule?
</P>
<P>
CI: I work all the time. I&#146m defined by my work to maybe a not such a good degree. 
</P>
<P>
CC: And have you made any new discoveries recently?
</P>
<P>
CI: My discoveries have always been small ones because I do work on the wheel. I have sort of decided that I want the pots to be affordable. That limits the time spent altering them and decorating them. Right now, as a matter of fact, I am very interested in incised line patterns. It is a tiny bit conflicting because it does take more time, but I love it. 
</P>
<P>
CC: Where do you see yourself in the ceramic world?
</P>
<P>
CI: Since so many people are embroidering on the basic craft, I guess I am beginning to feel a little missionary zeal about just staying within the absolute foundations, just so that it&#146s present. So as other folks elaborate, the reference point is still vital and alive.
