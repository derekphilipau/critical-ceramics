</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><A HREF="http://www.rit.edu/~652www/ceramics/ceramicsfaculty.htm">Julia Galloway</A> spoke with Forrest Snyder from Critical Ceramics late in the summer of 1999 while team-teaching with <A HREF="/articles/haysta99/akarros.htm ">Alec Karros</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.haystack-mtn.org/">Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</A>. Julia will return to Haystack this fall, 2000, to teach a four day workshop.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Critical Ceramics: What&#146s your background?
</P>

<P>
Julia Galloway: I was an undergraduate at <A HREF="http://nyscc.alfred.edu/">Alfred</A> from 1984 to 1988. Then I took two years off, during which I went to Japan for a summer. When I returned, I had a bit of a crisis. I thought, &#147;all the good pots have been made. Who was I [to improve this body of work]?&#148;
</P>

<P>
CC: That feeling hit you right away?
</P>

<P>
JG: Yes. It was so obvious. I had taken two years off and done large installations and performance art in Boston. I worked mostly with wine, manure, and hay in a big industrial space. After those two years, I realized that all those installations were very much about the same things that pots are about.
</P>

<P>
CC: Which is?
</P>

<P>
JG: Well, they&#146re about making spaces to sit and talk. Making small, intimate spaces out of huge spaces. I&#146m trying to personalize this urban/industrial world. You know, when you&#146re in the city and you smell hay, it&#146s kind of profound.
</P>

<P>
CC: At least a wake up call.
</P>

<P>
JG: Exactly. Then I realized that you couldn&#146t take it with you. At the end of each installation was this odd, uncomfortable time. I decided that pots were a better way to address my concerns. Plus, I grew up enough [during those two years] and realized that I could make pots that weren&#146t Japanese! 
</P>

<P>
CC: What happened next?
</P>

<P>
JG: I went to <A HREF="http://www.massart.edu/">Mass College of Art</A> for a year as a special student. I was there with some great students. In 1992, I went to the <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/~finearts/">University of Colorado - Boulder</A> for graduate school. I went there to study with Betty [Woodman]. With Betty, I wanted to study with a woman from an era. The Voulkos, Soldner, era.
</P>

<P>
CC: The first generation of modern ceramics.
</P>

<P>
JG: Right. I felt that it was very important to study with someone of that era. 
</P>

<P>
CC: Next, came...?
</P>

<P>
JG: My second to last semester at Boulder, I went to the <A HREF="http://www.nscad.ns.ca/">Nova Scotia College of Art and Design</A> [NASCAD]. I needed to work with more potters. There were no potters at Boulder!
</P>

<P>
CC: Why NASCAD?
</P>

<P>
JG: Its ceramic history and to work with Walter [Ostrom]. I felt at Boulder that I was defending pots all the time. I wanted to go to a school where [pottery] was taken for granted.
</P>

<P>
CC: Defending pottery?
</P>

<P>
JG: Yeah. I feel that if there&#146s not a preexisting history or structure [in the institution] then you end up defending pottery because it is a craft. Boulder is really a studio arts school. Don&#146t get me wrong, I don&#146t regret going there for a minute. I just needed to be somewhere to give me a little bit more backup. I needed some basic, historical, pottery knowledge. In graduate school, I learned all about installation, photography, video... that was really great, but I had to learn about Mesopotamia, Italy, and the Chinese. I just didn&#146t have any of that background.
</P>

<P>
We had this teacher, Marie Elwood, a curator, who basically took us over the Silk Road. She taught the ceramic history all through commodity and trade. There was no question. That history wasn&#146t about art and pots at all. She&#146d talk about those pots trading back and forth and then she&#146d open up her suitcase and pull one out! She had access to all these pots in the museums. It was outrageous! 
</P>

<P>
CC: After graduate school, how or why did you make the transition into teaching?
</P>

<P>
JG: I did a sabbatical replacement at William and Mary College. It was great because they just let me flail wildly. I mean, in your first year of teaching, what are you going to get made? A couple of cups would be good! Anyway, up until then, I had my doubts about teaching. What I found was that I learn so much when I teach. Being in an academic environment keeps my brain going. 
</P>

<P>
Before William and Mary, I went to the <A HREF="http://www.archiebray.org/">Archie Bray Foundation</A>. I was there for almost two years. A really good thing about being at the Bray was I decided that I had to figure out if pottery was going to be a career. The big &#147;C&#148; word. Becoming a professional is a big step.
</P>

<P>
CC: The Bray gave you time and space to refine?
</P>

<P>
JG: Yes. I think you figure out what you want to do and how you want to present yourself in a way that feels true. What&#146s so nice about the Bray, too, is that when you walk through the grounds, there&#146s work from everyone that you&#146ve ever heard of or studied. There&#146s a dusty old Peter Voulkos platter hanging on the bathroom wall. I got the sense of being part of a larger community. With that realization came a sense of responsibility. I thought, &#147;oh, I&#146m part of this. Oh, I&#146m REALLY part of this. Where are we going from here?&#148; I do feel very much part of the next generation. I understand the [recent] history, but that&#146s not my generation. 
</P>

<P>
CC: What is your responsibility, then?
</P>

<P>
JG: <A HREF="/reviews/shows/nc00cham.htm">Scott Chamberlin</A> would always ask, &#147;so, how are you adding to the larger body of knowledge?&#148; I believe that one must put the best of what one can back into the field so that it can grow and become richer.
</P>

<P>
CC: How do you reconcile that idea with the idea that you had when you returned from Japan? The idea that you could never make a pot that hadn&#146t been made before?
</P>

<P>
JG: Interesting. I&#146ve never put those two [ideas] together before. Basically, I think that I&#146ve grown up. I have a better understanding of the ceramic world. It&#146s bigger than shino or temmoku.
</P>

<P>
CC: Can you define what you want to put back into the field?
</P>

<P>
JG: I don&#146t know how to answer that future question directly, but I can tell you some things I&#146m interested in. I&#146m thrilled by the quality of utilitarian pottery being made in America, today. I want to help that to continue to grow stronger. Technically and formally, we&#146re so much better than ten years ago. Potters today seem smarter, clearer, more articulate. I want that momentum to continue. You know, when I was at Alfred, I never heard the word &lsquo;craftsman&#146 used outloud until 1988. 
</P>

<P>
CC: Are there trends or qualities that you don&#146t like?
</P>

<P>
JG: I&#146m really, really, really tired of black lines on orange flashing. Across the board. Woodfire, that stripe/flash is kind of the raku of the late 1990&#146s. The <A HREF="http://www.ferringallery.com/gallery/woodfiring_artists/ruggles_rankin.html">Ruggles and Rankin</A> style has consumed our field! Don&#146t get me wrong, they make some lovely pots; the problem is, now lots of other people make lovely Ruggles and Rankin pots, too. But this phenomena isn&#146t unique to pottery. Look at how many people are Martin Puryer once removed! 
</P>

<P>
CC: Hasn&#146t the quality of all the arts risen in the last ten years?
</P>

<P>
JG: Yes, although more has been lost, too. Because there&#146s less of something to bounce off of. The sculpture world, overall, is under tremendous stress. Anything goes in such a way that it&#146s unclear what even goes. This may be a product of more and better. 
</P>

<P>
CC: Has the marketplace influenced the crafts world? The academic world?
</P>

<P>
JG: That&#146s funny. In one way, I feel like grad students are always on the cutting edge [of contemporary art]. On the other hand, I think that it takes forever for the [academic] institutions to catch up. How do these two go together? There&#146s truth in both.
</P>

<P>
The public is willing to pay more for pots today. People are more interested in the handmade looking objects. Walk into Pier 1 Imports and have a look. There is a smaller, more sophisticated, audience that is willing to pay a premium for the handmade decorative object. These people are my target audience. I&#146m not competing with mass retail or industry - I can&#146t - but I sell out [my shows].
</P>

<P>
CC: What are you trying to achieve with that pitcher or this mug?
</P>

<P>
JG: Two things. First, the making process is the most exciting thing to me. However, I wouldn&#146t do it and have nothing to show for the effort. I&#146m not a performance artist. Second, by show a relationship between two objects - creamer and sugar bowl, for example - I hope to get the user thinking about their own relationships; on some level they have a relationship with my object and, through that, a relation to me, the maker. 
</P>

<P>
CC: Is the challenge to make this purpose as clear as possible or as obscure as possible?
</P>

<P>
JG: Hopefully, you do both! In the most clear part, I want users to know that the piece is part of a pair or group. Salt and Pepper. Oil and Vinegar. Cream and Sugar. Then, as the piece gets used, becomes known, I hope there&#146s a deeper, more obscured, non-verbal understanding. 
</P>

<P>
CC: How do you approach making a body of work?
</P>

<P>
JG: The biggest changes to the work happen when I have to move. When I move, the work changes. I worry about changing [either too much or not enough], but I shouldn&#146t really. Daily, I always have a plan. Today, I&#146m working on teapots and cream and sugar sets. 
</P>

<P>
CC: Finishing up, is there anything else you&#146d like to touch on?
</P>

<P>
JG: I&#146d like to say one thing that&#146s been on my mind. Since, I&#146ll be teaching at the <A HREF="http://www.rit.edu/~652www/ceramics/ceramics1.html">Rochester Institute of Technology, School for American Crafts</A>, I&#146ve become a bit perplexed as to how modern technology and pottery meet. Then <A HREF="http://www.johnelder.com/johnstest/Exhibits/func2-Sikora.htm">Linda Sikora</A> put a new light on the two. She pointed out that practitioners in both fields are absolutely obsessed with process.
