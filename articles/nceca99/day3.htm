Friday morning was devoted to off-site visits, including a return to the Cultural  Arts Center&#146s &#147Evolving Clay&#148 exhibition (see Wednesday&#146s overview), and a trip to Hopkins Hall at Ohio State University to browse through the Ceramic Reunion Exhibition and Silent Auction.  What a wonderful variety of work!  Deborah Horrell&#146s &#147In the Beginning&#148 absolutely sang with the light passing through her pate de verre glass.  Maurice Grossman&#146s two raku-fired vessels were thrown, broken and reassembled to form a decidedly masculine enterprise and Don Reitz was also represented with a 3 1/2' tall salt-fired sculptural work.  My favorite was a collection of Rebecca Harvey dinnerware, press-molded and assembled porcelain in clear bright hues of orange, blue and lime green.
</P>

<P>
We also stopped in at the Arthur E. Baggs Memorial Library Collection in the basement of Hopkins Hall to view pots by Paul Bogatay, Margaret  Steenrod Fetzer, Edgar Littlefield, Adelaid Alsop Robineau and Beatrice Wood, to mention just a few.  A superb international collection of books, too (kept under tight lock and key).
</P>

<P>
The afternoon I reserved for just two sessions: the second part of simultaneous demos by Mark Hewitt, Rebecca Harvey and Charles McWeeny and Rick Sherman&#146s break-out topical discussion on the intricacies of building and nurturing a nonprofit organization.
</P>

<P>
The demos were impressive.  The jam-packed ballroom was enhanced with overhead video (don&#146t know the name of the videographer, but he moved smoothly between the three demonstrators).  Mark Hewit worked on a series of large-scale pots, one of which was thrown in parts and then attached, and one coil-built planter nearly as tall as myself.  Rebecca Harvey did a fine job explaining her mold-making process and producing a number of her sensual, rounded pieces all the while answering questions from the audience.  Charles McWeeny worked on one of his trademark slab-built torsos, completing the final design colorations and keeping the audience laughing as he traded patter with Mark.
</P>

<P>
 I had to leave early to get over to the ballroom two floors away where Rick Sherman and other topical discussion leaders collected some 300 participants to talk about a variety of special-interest issues, ranging from creating ceramic art and creating culinary art (&#147Dish for Dish&#148) to &#147Educational Standards in Clay,&#148 to &#147Everything You Wanted to Know About Grad School Applications.&#148
</P>

<P>
Rick assembled about 25 people in his group and we went round-robin to offer brief introductions and specific concerns.  Rick began by explaining the differences between mutual-benefit (501(c)(4) and (6) nonprofits) and public-benefit (501(c)(3) corporations and the IRS&#146 definition of each, then gave the floor to his wife, Marcella, an expert in the field of grant applications.  She described the different levels of grants, going into some detail about sources of corporate/private foundations, government, and individual monies, and the moved on to the details of actually writing a grant.  The group discussion that followed was lively and informative and covered a lot, including how to write a successful mission statement, the importance of directors/officers and general liability insurance, how to conduct capital campaigning, and how to run a non-profit without even needing grant monies.  Much information was exchanged and judging from the energy of the group, I believe that most of us came away with good ideas on how to begin and/or manage our own particular organizations.
</P>

<P>
This pretty much marks the end of the NCECA 1999 experience for me as I&#146ll be returning home to California tomorrow.  In closing, I have to say this: the people I&#146ve met and the ideas exchanged and the visual feast of clay art that was laid out so generously have made my first foray into NCECA-land a memorable one.  And I know I&#146ll be traveling to Denver next year for NCECA-2000.
