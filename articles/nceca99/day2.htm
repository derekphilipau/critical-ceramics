Thursday I decided to stay at the Convention Center and glad-hand my way around the various exhibitors booths and take in the on-site exhibitions.
</P>

<P>
I stopped in (twice!) at the Student Fellowship Cup Funds display of five tables' worth of cups, mugs, goblets, teabowls and more donated by so many big-hearted potters.  D. Harchin's cup and saucer, complete with numerous embedded galvanized nails, brought a smile to my face.  Aria French's elegant, ribbon-handled mug swam inside and out in vivid swathes of teal, yellow, black, red and blue.  Judy Tryon offered a bold four-sided mug, sprayed in blue, green and yellow.  Richard Burkett was again represented with a slab-built, salt-fired piece with extruded and scored handle that was just sweet to the touch.  And Linda Arbuckle's earthenware cup was lushly decorated in the majolica tradition.
</P>

<P>
I moved on to the K-12 exhibition, juried, incidentally by Ms. Arbuckle.  This was a small exhibition but well displayed and featuring some surprises.  My favorite was the "Oilcan Collection," a series of pieces executed by Ryan Thomas.  It's a quiet grouping in amber, matte green, blue and metallic grey glazes, and shows this 9th graderï¿½s budding technical skills.  10th grader Jessika Och's "Madeline" is a fine 3' high sculpture of a girl balancing a dish in each hand, glazed in a copper matt.  Unfortunately the piece was marred as each arm had broken off and been reattached (with glue, I think).  Another otherwise bold sculptural work, "Enlightenment" by 9th Grader Travis Highley was similarly marked by evidence of glued breakage.  Finally, "Mingling" is a group of 7 coiled and altered cones dressed in a subtle copper glaze, exhibited by Shawnda Sneed, an 11th grader with a nice eye for balance and technique.
</P>

<P>
My last stop for of the day was the Ceramics Monthly International Exhibition.  Maybe I was just  getting tired and cranky, but there seemed to be a preponderance of big Bigger BIGGEST.  Thus, I was refreshed to see Andrea Fabrega's porcelain miniatures displayed -- she's a local in my area (we go to the same dentist!) and I see her work every year that I  can.  Just wish I could afford it.  Her group included a tiny functional teapot, lidded vessel, and an urn suspended in a metal tripod, all glazed in a eye-warming black matte.  Nila Petty's earthenware, unglazed wallhanging, "The Gaze" was striking --  a headless female nude being contemplated by a plinthe-mounted bust.  Also, John Albert Murphy's detailed black and white installation "Diversity" is comprised of 11 separate pieces and in different shapes (cylinders, platters, cube, balls and cone), glazed in an assortment of stripes, and stacked -- a remarkable study in balance and form.  And, just for something different, "The English Chair" by Samantha Cotteril is a nearly life-sized spindle-backed chair, replete with a broken spindle, and finished in an oxide wash.
</P>

<P>
I think I've seen more pottery and sculpture at NCECA 1999 in the past two days than I have in the last two years.  I've learned that pacing oneself is the name of the game, but with so much to do and so little time...!
