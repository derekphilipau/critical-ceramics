If you like high energy, the chance to meet up with thousands of people, attend demos, lectures, art and commercial exhibitions, and explore new cities, then the annual conference of the National Counil for the Ceramic Arts is not to be missed -- a definite E-ticket ride in the wonderland of ceramics.
</P>
<P>
I had the opportunity to travel from San Jose, California to Columbus, Ohio for the NCECA 1999 event, now in it's 33rd year.  By way of brief introduction, I am a self-taught studio potter who developed a passion for clay six years ago.  I am not an art critic, and this is my first NCECA expedition.  Figuring that my novice status as an NCECA participant might offer others a fresh view of what has become for many an annual pilgrimage, I offered to do a short day-by-day write-up for Critical Ceramics.   Following are a few highlights and my observations.
</P>

The Oddessy Begins<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Wednesday was devoted to travelling in and around the city of Columbus, visiting various exhibitions and the Orton Factory.
</P>

<P>
First  stop:  The Cultural Arts Center for the 1999 NCECA Clay Nationals, a five-week exhibition of 66 pieces culled from over 2,000 entries by jurors Ron Meyers, Robert Brady and Tre Arenz, and all for sale.  The show, housed in a renovated brick arsenol,.c 1861, hosted a variety of work, a lot of it serial in nature and some interesting sculpture too.   Many many names unknown to me, but I know what captures my attention.   All of the work was interesting and I�ll comment on just a few:
</P>

<P>
The installation coming in the front door is "Head," an earthenware series of more than 250 small skulls by Billy Mayer, each topped with a memoric symbol, and developed over a 5-year period.  Body parts seemed to abound as I moved on to Sandra Westley�s "Crowd" of 35 pairs of stoneware feet, with an oxide wash.  Karen Turbo offered a sculptural rendition of a giant  "Goldfish", lively and well-executed.  Richard Burkett�s wood-fired porcelain "Anagama Footed Tray," featured random porcelain "dowels" inserted and broken off into the sides.  Jessica Parker�s series of five functional porcelain "Lidded Expresso Cups," soda-fired, included saucers, the rim of each which is gently pinched and twisted.  Nice touch.  And finally I have to mention Marilyn Lysohir�s powerful "Tattooed Ladies (Dresses)", a sculptural series of three female headless/armless forms on pedastals, the forms draped in dresses colorfully patterned with evocative designs and drawings. An arresting and thought-provoking collection.
</P>

<P>
Next stop was Otterbein College in the town of Westerville about 15 miles away.  We stopped briefly to look at a small exhibition in the lobby of what appeared to be the Music building.  Hiroko Asano�s 10 porcelain anchors embedded in a 3'x7' bed of white sand was a definite eye-catcher.  Then it was on to Roush Hall to explore the permanent collection of pottery from Africa and New Guinea, specifically from the regions of the Niger River and the Sepik River.  Bamako, Mali, was home to me when I was travelling with my State Department family, and so seeing much of this work brought back some fine memories.  There's nothing tentative about this heavy utilitarian work which is coiled, beaten and incised earthenware, pitfired in a host of different materials including dung, wood, palm fronds, and coconut shells.  Pottery making is these areas is primarily the woman�s domaine, with men sometimes doing the decoration.  An interesting aside: Some of the tribal culture along the Niger River dictates that a divorced woman keep all her pots and subsequent revenue from sales.  Conversely, a woman convicted of an infraction is punished by having all her pots destroyed.  A harsh penalty in any culture, I should think.
</P>

<P>
We finished our travels in Westerville with a visit to the Orton factory.  I thought at first this might be a dull tour and was pleasantly surprised.  Tim Frederich, Orton�s Product Support and Center Coordinator, gave a short but very thorough run-down of how junior and senior cones are manufactured, packaged and stored.  I was struck by the energy of the workers in this small plant -- they all appeared to genuinely enjoy their work, and one 10-year veteran was good-natured even when baited by a tour participant who kept asking "How can you keep doing all this repetitive work without going out of your mind?"  Tim was able to dispense a little advice about a problem I was having with my cone 04's breaking before the sensing rod had a chance to drop it (always load those little suckers with the number facing down, since that side of the cone is the most dense and therefore heaviest), and he counseled another participant about cone-freeze.  All in all a worthwhile side-trip, and it�s good to have a contact at Orton.
</P>

<P>
Back at the hotel I made a brief stop at the Clayart hospitality room, then off to dinner with friends at a remarkable restaurant in downtown�s Germantown. ( I think I've become a bit jaded with the glut of restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area and was delighted to find my palate revived, and to hear others echo that Columbus is full of some really fine eating places).  More Wednesday, assuming recovery from today is complete!
